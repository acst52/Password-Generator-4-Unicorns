### 03 - Password Generator Using JavaScript: Password Generator 4 Unicorns

In this coding bootcamp challenge we were asked to create a password generator based on user input using only javascript. In my password generator, which you can find ![here](https://acst52.github.io/Password-Generator-4-Unicorns/), you will notice that users can select how long they want their password to be (8-128 characters), whether they want to include lowercase, uppercase letters, numbers and/or special characters. The password will then be generated in the box for the user to grab. Note that every character type that the user selects is guaranteed to be included in their password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

Regarding the acceptance criteria,
  1. The user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
  2. The user can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
  3. The user can confirm whether or not to include LC, UC, numeric and/or special characters
  4. User input is validated (at least one character type must be selected)
  5. A password is generated that matches the selected criteria, written to the page
